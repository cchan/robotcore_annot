compile.py
foreach *.jftc file in current directory
-Split classes into different files with proper names, register them into Manager, various imports and stuff
-motor stuff from central config - declarations and matchings
-Put it into proper directory in file
-compile and load onto phone

-should add libraries - joystick thresholding automatically, etc. - maybe the motor stuff could be not pasted in but instead be part of a library?



EXAMPLE

-----Hardware.json-----
{
motorThrower:{type:"motor",reverse:true}, //Throws balls
motorLift:{type:"motor"}, //Lifts scorer
servoGrabber:{type:"servo",hardwareName:"grabber"}, //Locks hood
}

-----Robot.jftc-----
public class Teleop extends OpMode{
	public void start(){
		motorThrower.setPower(100);
	}
	public void run(){}
	public void stop(){}
}
